## Course rationale

[Scientific controversy](https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/_0_0/sciencetoolkit_06) over fundamental hypotheses is critical for the progress of science. Disagreements over which hypotheses are best supported by the available evidence, how data should be interepreted, and which ideas are worth investigating further have the potential to shake our knowledege and transform our understanding of particular scientifc fields. Evolution and Ecology are two fields fraught with scientific controversy. The idea of this course will be to review some of these controversies, read foundational papers covering the *pro* / *con* positions, and summarize the state of the field in relation to such controversial topics. In the spirit of our gradaute program, we plan to span a broad range of topics, from macroevolution to functional ecology and behavior. The final list of topics will be decided depending on enrollment and student's interests. However, a preliminary list of topics includes: do we need a new evolutionary sysnthesis? should the intermediate disturbance hypothesis be abandonded? is a theory of macroevolution necessary? is kin selection a thing? does species selection work? are there ecological limits to diversity/diversification? is trait-based ecology a shifting paradigm in ecology? do we need phylogenies to understand ecological processes? is sympatric speciation possible? are the fossil record and "molecular record" at odds tracking the history of life? is epigentics bringing Lamarckian theories back? does the neutral theory (of ecology and/or molecular evolution) need a rethink?

## Course format

This is a discussion-based seminar with short presentations and open discussions every week. To this end, all participants of the seminar are expected to read all papers assigned each week, as well as to bring in depth questions for discussion. Each week two student moderators will lead the session. The student moderators will make a **short** presentation on the selected topic, one presenting the *pro*, the other presenting the *con* positions, bring an annotated bibliography (2-4 extra papers), and moderate discussions along with the instructor. The overall idea would be to focus on the big picture controversy and not much into *technical controversy* (e.g., paper A uses method X and paper B uses method Y). No one (**including the instructor**) is an expert in all topics we will cover, so hopefully we will all learn together.


## Learning objectives

In this seminar, students will:

* Gain knowledge about foundational controversies in evolution and ecology
* Develop the ability to identify and explain key concepts in evolution and ecology, as well as expand on the most significant conclusions presented in the readings 
* Develop scientific communication skills
